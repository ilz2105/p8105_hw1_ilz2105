```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

The chunk below contains:
a random sample of size 8 from a standard Normal distribution
a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 0
a character vector of length 8
a factor vector of length 8, with 3 different factor “levels”

```{r df_create}

plot_df = tibble(
  ran_samp = rnorm(8),
  log_vec = x >0,
  vec_char = character(length = 8),
  fac_vec = vec_char, levels= c(0, 1, 2),
    labels=c("level_1", "level_2", "level_3")
)


```

First we show a histogram of the `x` variable.

```{r x_hist}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram()
```

Next we show a scatterplot of `y` vs `x`. 

```{r yx_scatter}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```
